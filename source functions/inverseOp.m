% Code for defining inverse operator in SAR Image Formation/Reconstruction
% application in [1]. The inverse operator is basically the back-projection
% operation. This function creates an image from the input phase history.

% INPUT
%       ** x    : Input. (Phase history) 
%
% OUTPUT
%       ** y    : Output. (Image)
