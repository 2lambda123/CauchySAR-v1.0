% Code for generating multiplicative speckle noise.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% INPUTS:
%       ** numLooks     : Number of looks.
%
%       ** rowSize      : Number of rows for the generated speckle noise.
%
%       ** colSize      : Number of columns for the generated speckle noise.
%
%       ** dist         : Speckle distribution.
%                         1 --> Gamma distribution.
%                         2 --> Lognormal distribution.
%                         3 --> No-noise mimicking.
%
% OUTPUT:  
%       ** noise        : Generated speckle noise sequence.
