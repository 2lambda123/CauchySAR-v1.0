%% CauchySAR_v1-SAR Inverse Problem Solving via Cauchy Proximal Splitting %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Script for inverse problem solution for SAR image formation/reconstruction 
% via the non-convex Cauchy penalty function.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Some Important Variables
%       ** structSAR            : Structure type variable which includes various 
%           important parameters for the measurements. For details please
%           see the function LoadSARDataRecons.m.
%
%       ** structSARMF          : A copy of structSAR for the Matched
%           Filter calculations.
%
%       ** target               : Variable representing the target. For this 
%           code it can only get 'Camry' value.
% 
%       ** phaseHistData        : Input of the CPS algorithm. The phase
%           history measurements.
%       ** A & AH               : Forward and inverse projection operators. 
%
%       ** normdB               : Minimum intensity value in decibels.
%
%       ** mu                   : CPS Step Size
%
%       ** gamma                : The Cauchy penalty function scale
%           parameter.
%
%       ** epsilon              : A vector variable which stores the error 
%           value for each iteration.
%
%       ** errorCriterion       : Target error value.
%
%       ** maxIter              : Maximum number of iterations of CPS
%           algorithm.
%
%       ** CPSRecons            : CPS Resonctructed Image.
%
%       ** normImCauchy         : Normalised CPS reconstructed image.
